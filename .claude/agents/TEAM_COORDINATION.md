## Collaboration Patterns

### Daily Coordination
- Each agent maintains awareness of dependencies and interfaces
- Clear handoff protocols between phases and commits
- Shared understanding of TypeScript patterns and project conventions

### Cross-Agent Collaboration
- **Architecture Reviews**: MCP Architect and Message Systems Engineer coordinate on interfaces
- **Security Integration**: Security Engineer reviews all components for security compliance
- **Testing Strategy**: Testing Engineer works with each specialist on domain-specific testing
- **Documentation Support**: Documentation Lead works with each agent on examples and guides

### Quality Gates
- All code follows existing ESLint and TypeScript strict mode configurations
- Security Engineer reviews all input validation and access control implementations
- Testing Engineer ensures 90%+ coverage before any commit
- Documentation Lead ensures examples and guides are complete and accurate

## Technical Standards Alignment

### Code Quality
- Follow CLAUDE.md guidelines for git workflow and commit practices
- Use one-liner commit messages without mentioning AI assistance
- Implement proper error handling and TypeScript strict typing
- All features require corresponding tests before completion

### Security Requirements
- All inputs validated using Zod schemas
- Encryption at rest for sensitive data
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Webhook security with HMAC verification

### Performance Targets
- < 100ms message processing latency
- < 50ms storage write operations
- < 200ms search queries across 10k messages
- 100+ concurrent message handling capability

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- All 15+ MCP tools implemented with consistent interfaces
- 90%+ test coverage across all components
- All performance targets met consistently
- Zero security vulnerabilities in final implementation

### Team Coordination Metrics
- All commits follow planned scope and timeline
- Clean handoffs between phases with minimal rework
- Consistent code quality across all team members
- Successful integration of all components into cohesive system

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Integration Complexity**: Regular interface reviews between agents
- **Performance Issues**: Early performance testing during development
- **Security Gaps**: Continuous security review across all phases

### Coordination Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Strict adherence to defined commit boundaries
- **Interface Misalignment**: Shared TypeScript interfaces and regular coordination
- **Timeline Pressure**: Focus on MVP features with clear success criteria

This team structure ensures both deep domain expertise and effective collaboration while maintaining the project's ambitious timeline and quality standards.
